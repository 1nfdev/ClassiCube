* Note that the first time you run the launcher, a dialog box will pop up with the message 
"Some required resources weren't found." Just click OK. (This is because I cannot redistribute 
the assets of MineCraft Classic with the application as they are the copyrighted property of Mojang)

The launcher is divided into 3 tabs. They are:
1) Local tab
This is for connecting to classic servers that are hosted on the same computer as you, 
or that are in the same LAN network.
* You do not have to be connected to the internet to play in this mode. (Note that you won't see 
custom skins if you are not connected to the internet, however)

Click "connect" to start the client.

2) MineCraft.net
# Note: Mojang appears to have deleted all of the unpaid free accounts. Premium accounts should still
# work though. The public servers list on minecraft.net is also completely stuffed, as most servers
# that appear on the list that are either fake or don't actually exist anymore. 
# You are probably better off just using ClassiCube.net.

You will need to provide the username and password for your minecraft.net account. Then click sign in.

If sign-in was successful, two new tabs should appear beside 'Sign in'.
You can then either: 
A) Browse the public servers list and click on a cell (Which will then fill in the hash textbox) 
B) Directly enter in a hash into the hash textbox.

Then click "connect". The launcher will then download the necessary information about the server from minecraft.net and start the client.

3) ClassiCube.net
The process is the exact same as described under minecraft.net. (except that signing in, downloading skins, and retrieving server information is done through classicube.net)
