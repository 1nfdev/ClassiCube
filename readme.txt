ClassicalSharp is a custom Minecraft Classic client written in C#. 
It is not affiliated with (or supported by) Mojang AB, Minecraft, or Microsoft in any way.


=== What ClassicalSharp is === 
* Works with both Minecraft.net and ClassiCube.net
* Lightweight, minimal memory usage compared to standard client.
* Should work with effectively all graphics cards that support OpenGL.


=== What ClassicalSharp is not ===
* It does not work with 'modern/premium' minecraft servers.
* It does not provide singleplayer support.


=== Requirements ===
* ClassicalSharp requires .NET Framework 2.0. (Vista and above already include later versions of the .NET Framework)
* Mono should also work in theory, but I have not tested that.


=== Todo list ===
* Texture animations.
* Proper SelectionBox sorting.
* DirectX API support.
* Some of the remaining CPE extensions.
* Test that Mojang Accounts work properly.
* Fix issues with framerate limiting not working properly on same cards.
